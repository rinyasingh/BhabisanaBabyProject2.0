      <h3>Introduction and Context</h3>
      <p> As technology has developed and has become more important in daily use, a variety of factors have been identified as influencing the acceptance of a technology by the users.
          Users' motivations can be used by developers to improve the technology's design in an attempt to increase usage.
          This study uses the Unified Theory of Acceptance-2 (UTAUT-2) to analyse the acceptance of the technology of these communities.  
      </p>
        <p><b>The key aims factors proposed by the UTAUT-2 as influencing users' usage of an application:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Performance Expectancy: </b>The degree to which the user believes that the system will assist them reach their goals- whether job-related or otherwise.</li>
          <li><b>Effort Expectancy: </b>The degree to which the user perceives the system as being easy to use.</li>
          <li><b>Social Influence: </b>the degree to which the user perceives that other individuals who are important to them will react to their use of the system.</li>
          <li><b>Facilitating Conditions: </b>The degree to which the user believes that organisational and technical infrastructure exists to support their use of the system.</li>
          <li><b>Hedonic Motivation: </b>The enjoyment a user derives from using the technology.</li>
          <li><b>Price Value: </b>The user's perceived overall benefit or loss as a
            result of whatever monetary cost there is to using the system.</li>
          <li><b>Habit: </b>The extent to which people learn to perform behaviours automatically.</li>
        </ul>
        Given the socioeconomic differences between the communities of the BBP's beneficiaries and the community of Sweetwaters, these factors are proposed to have varying levels of effect on the overall usage of that community of the mobile application.

        <h3>Methodology</h3>
        <p>
          <h3>Workshops</h3>
          To facilitate conversations between researchers and the communities where the application was deployed, a series of workshops were held. <br>
          <b>BBP Workshop 1</b><br>
          First, a workshop was held with BBP beneficiaries who had been using the app- with varying frequency- since its deployment in 2022.
          This workshop provided researchers with key insights surrounding the issues with the previous application that rendered it unusable by the beneficiaries. 
          Additionally, participants provided researchers with essential feedback surrounding requirements and usability issues.
          <br>
          <b>Sweetwaters</b><br>
          Once this team's iteration of the mobile app had been prototyped, we held a workshop in Sweetwaters, KZN, with nine participants- all of whom were mothers or grandmothers.
          As this group of participants had not been part of the initial co-design process between past students and the BBP, this workshop consisted of introducing the application to them, iliciting feedback and a content creation workshop.
          This content creation was necessary as the lack of an NGO in this space to proliferate content meant that the focus shifted to the community creating their own videos.
          <br>
          <b></b>
        </p>
        <h3>Create User Profiles and ECD Content</h3>
      <p>
        
      </h3>
      <p>The "Assigned Posts" custom field displays an interface to assign ECD posts to a User. 
        
      </p>
      <h3>Custom Plugin to create REST API Endpoint</h3>
      <p> 
        
      </p>
        <h3>Dashboard (Portal) Customization</h3>
        <p>The custom plugin abstracts all unnecessary WordPress options and adds user help with quick links and online documentation. 
          This allows for a streamlined dashboard where the Bhabhisana staff have no access over anything besides ECD Content and User management. 
          Additionally to using a learnable and fun system, the portal is quick with executing key functions within the browser.</p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p> Bhabhisana staff acknowledged "I am not technically advanced", but "I can get used to this and will gain confidence", which highlights the positive mindset they had to the usability of the system. On conclusion of the sessions with Bhabhisana staff, a usability evaluation was conducted to highlight the usability and satisfaction of the web portal. <br>The following results were collected:</p>
        <img src="assets/img/portfolio/findings.png" class="thirty" alt=""><p class="fst-italic">
        <p>The satisfaction results show we have created a system the stakeholders desired, and it performs the required functionality as they anticipated. Since inception of the live domain (26/08), the staff created a total of 19 Users and 1 ECD Content, assigning a cumulative 28 ECD Content to Users. In reference to our key aims and success factors, we can therefore consider this implementation a success as Bhabhisana staff are comfortable using the system that satisfies their key aims.</p>
