      <h2>Context Background</h2>
      <p>Bhabisana Baby Project(BBP), the Non Governmental Organisation sought to assist caregivers in poor communities
        to meet fundamental needs, however, they required a user-friendly way to easily distribute and manage
        availability of digital content and resources. In this research we utilised results from research done by CoMaCH
        Project-co-designing for Maternal and Child Health in collaboration with BBP in building out the system and
        providing content needed. The aim of this research is to explore an effective approach of ECD content
        distribution to parents in resource-constrained communities.<br>
        The mobile application’s primary functionality serves as an interface between the BBP staff and parents. In this
        project we develop a native Android Kotlin application for parents and caregivers from poor and resource
        constrained communities. The project aimed to develop and conduct usability studies on a native Android mobile
        application that would assist the BBP staff in distributing custom curated ECD content. </p>

      <h2>Overview of Mobile Application Development</h2>
      <p>A three phased iterative development approach was followed. Each successive version incorporated the feedback received through stakeholder meetings and user workshops.</p>
      <h3>Iteration 1</h3>
      <p>The first iteration contained unprocessed ECD web portal content, pdf article viewer, and a facilities map search. The mobile application retrieved post content via a SQL connection to the web portals database. The content was streamed from the hosted media files and was displayed through the native Android video view. Users were able to view a base set of PDF articles. The facilities search feature was initially implemented as an activity were users would create their own maps, placing markers on locations for later viewing.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="mobile-flex">
          <p class="fst-italic">Iteration 1 based on CoMaCH co-design activities</p>
      </div>
      <h3>Iteration 2</h3>
      <p>The second iteration added the capabilities to download content and save media files to local storage. This ensured that the app remained usable during limited internet connectivity. The web portal content fetched was also pre-processed in this iteration to ensure that content was presented in an interpretable format. The search feature was implemented, however, it only returned exact query matches. The facilities search was refined to show users a list of curated local amenities and contact details of support structures across Western Cape. The creation of user maps was removed as it was quite cumbersome and didn’t meet the requirements of the intended functionality. User authentication was added to this iteration and allowed users to login and authenticate themselves. It allowed users to sync/download content related to their profile. The user interface was updated to be fully responsive in portrait and landscape orientations. The design was improved making it visually appealing and aligned with the BBP branding. </p>
      <h3>Iteration 3</h3>
      <p>In the third iteration filtering and searching of data was improved significantly. Users were now able to filter posts by assigned category. The search functionality no longer required exact matches. Communication of system status was improved through the use of snackbar notifications which explains changes that occur in the system. Contextual activity based help was implemented to ensure that users were able to easily recover from erroneous/unfavourable states.</p>

          <p class="fst-italic">Final Deployed Application</p>
      </div>
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>The mobile application has been deployed on the Playstore and fulfils the functional and non-functional
        requirements of both the supervisor and core stakeholders i.e. Bhabisana Baby Project and CoMaCH.The application
        is intuitive, updates dynamically, and optimally mirrors the webportal in resource constrained environments. The
        system was evaluated through parent workshops, heuristic evaluations and system tests. The results are outlined
        below.</p>

      <h3>Workshops</h3>
      <p>The feedback from workshops indicate that parents learnt the application easily and needed little to no
        assistance when attempting to complete tasks. The application leveraged affordances of other commonly used
        native Android applications. During debriefs, parents described the application as being minimalistic, usable
        and meeting their needs effectively. Observations showed that parents with older children found the application
        less useful as they had already learnt most of what the base content covered and were familiar with it from
        experience. They did, however, see the value of the application - Parent 3: <i>My baby is now three so I know
          most of this, but this app would have made life so much easier back then.</i> During the debriefing session
        parents and staff expressed feelings of pride and joy - Parent 4: <i>I am so proud to see that my work from the
          past year in these workshops has made this app.</i></p>

      <h3>Heuristic evaluation</h3>
      <p>Feedback was obtained from two of the core stakeholders from the CoMaCH project and two HCILab students using
        Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability heuristics as an evaluation guideline. All participants have conducted research in
        the space of HCI and ICT4D. The heuristic evaluation aided in identifying key issues with the mobile
        application. The heuristic evaluation revealed issues with regards to communication of system status and how to
        interact with certain user-interface components. All the issues identified by the experts were resolved in the
        final deployed application.</p>

      <h3>System Testing</h3>
      <p>The testing methodology used allowed our test to have a large amount of coverage and assisted greatly in
        delivering a maintainable bug free system. The mobile application was tested through three approaches:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Code based Espresso Framework testing</li>
        <li>Playstore automated testing</li>
        <li>Quality assurance testing conducted by experienced developers</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The Playstore and Espresso framework testing proved to be rather useful when testing our software before
        deployment as it tested our application with an exhaustive set of inputs and various devices. Whilst the
        automated code based testing mimicked user interactions effectively, the involvement of participants performing
        quality assurance tests was beneficial. The mindset of our testers seemed to assist greatly in discovering
        scenarios that would break the application or enter an unrecoverable state. Their experience in Mobile design
        and development projects certainly helped as this aided in finding flaws that may have been overlooked by the
        team. <a href="assets/img/submissions/suvanth/testDocMobileApp.pdf" target="_blank">(Detailed test
          documentation)</a></p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>All requirements and expectations of the stakeholders were effectively met. On project completion the NGO staff
        and parents were quite happy and many expressed that they were very proud that their efforts in the workshops
        conducted across the past two years have culminated into something that is tangible. The application does
        simplify the NGOs workflow of distributing content to their parents. The application also makes the task of
        finding personally relevant and optimistic ECD resources much easier for parents to source. Future work on the
        mobile application could include adding more fine grained control to the content synchronisation functionality
        and building out a more robust search functionality that leverages sophisticated information retrieval and
        natural language processing techniques in order to increase the relevancy of results. The application developed
        appears to be a success, however, the lack of user studies/evaluations conducted in an uncontrolled environment
        is a major limiting factor. The application needs to be used at scale over a longer duration before we may claim
        its success.</p>
