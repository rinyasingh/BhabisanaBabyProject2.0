      <h1>Introduction and Context</h1>
      <p>The previous web system was developed using WordPress. WordPress allows users to create, manage and publish digital content such as text, images and videos.
      </p>
        <!-- <img src="assets/img/portfolio/archportal.png" class="sixty" alt=""> -->
      <p><b>The key features of the system were:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The staff-facing web portal performed the functionality of allowing web portal users to create and manage content and users, emphasising content assignment functionality.</li>
        <li>The user-facing web application allows users to authenticate, view content based on categories and languages, and access assigned content. The mobile application was designed to have responsiveness, usability, and coherent branding features. </li>
      </ul>

      <p><b>The problems identified with the 2022 deployment:</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The staff reported that it was difficult to use the web portal due to its unintuitive interface.</li>
        <li>The quality of JSON response returned by the WordPress API endpoints was large and poorly structured due to the lack of customisability that WordPress allows for API design. String manipulation needed to be done by the mobile application to extract file links.</li>
        <li>There was a lack of proper user authentication. Users were only authenticated based on whether the username existed. When content was retrieved for the mobile application, only the user ID was used. There was no password check or session validation performed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h1>Methodology</h1>
      <p>The project management methodology used for this project was an
        agile scrum methodology. The reasoning behind this was to ensure
        the projectâ€™s iterative development and hold ourselves accountable
        to complete our tasks. This was important as the nature of the
        project divisions was highly coupled.</p>
        
      <!-- <h2>Authenticate Users</h2>
        <p>All users can login via the "User Login" button which allows them to securely log into the WordPress website.</p>
      <h2>Public vs Logged in User Permissions</h2>
      <p> All ECD Content posts are displayed based on User permissions which is which posts they have been assigned. If a user is logged in, the system visibility status is altered: Prompts for a user to login are removed, a logout button is added, they are personally addressed by name, and they can see their "Assigned Content" category and posts - which is not available to guests. All assigned content posts are styled in a darker purple hue to ensure parents can easily differentiate between that and the public content. This was achieved through consistent category classification per post, within the code-blocks.</p>

      <h2>Displaying ECD Content Pages</h2>
      <p>Each non-public ECD Content post is only displayed to that User if they are assigned it.</p> -->

      <h1>Results</h1>
      <p>The new system was built using the Django framework, featuring a Model-View-Template (MVT) pattern and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer. The system's architecture is divided into apps, each with specific functionality, and the user interface is created using HTML templates and Bootstrap. The system emphasizes user authentication, security, and database design, using a PostgreSQL database and Django's ORM. The system is currently hosted on a Unix server with Apache and Docker containers.</p>
      <p>The usability tests conducted throughout the project confirmed that the primary design objective of creating a user-centric system was achieved. Feedback from BBP staff participating in these tests indicated that the new web portal is a significant improvement over the previous one. They described it as more intuitive, with a cleaner and simpler interface, and one staff member even praised its appearance and ease of use.</p>
